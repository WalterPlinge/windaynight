### Windows theme toggler

Just run the exe to toggle the windows dark/light theme.
It sets both the System and App theme.

If you use it from the command line or a script, you can also choose the theme with the arguments `-dark` and `-light`.
This is useful when using Windows' Task Scheduler so it doesn't get out of sync.

How to build:
- `C`
  - `build.cmd`
- `Odin`
  - `odin build .`
